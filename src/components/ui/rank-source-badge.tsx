/**
 * Says where a ranking number came from, and how much to trust it.
 *
 * This is not decoration. The two sources measure different things:
 *
 *   Search Console — the average position real users saw on a given day,
 *                    from Google, lagging two to three days
 *   Live check     — the position one datacentre IP was shown just now
 *
 * A tracker that showed both as a bare "#7" would invent movement every
 * time a keyword crossed from one to the other, and the user would go
 * looking for a ranking change that never happened. CLAUDE.md's standing
 * rule after the August audit is that a number shown to a user needs
 * provenance: where it came from, how fresh, how confident. This is that,
 * for rankings.
