/**
 * The seven steps of a project, and the one to do next.
 *
 *   prospection -> setup -> audit -> strategy -> missions -> delivery -> followup
 *
 * Every step is read from what exists (an audit, a sent proposal, an active
 * mission, a report), never from a box someone ticked: a frieze that can
 * claim a step is done when it is not is worse than no frieze.
 *
 * Pure: no database, no React. The project page gathers the facts and
 * components/project-journey.tsx draws the result.
